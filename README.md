##Description
This is a multiple-choices quiz with five questions. For an unexperienced developer, it should be easy to use as the user only has to mark on the correct answer thus, help him/her familiarise with JavaScript.

###Technologies used
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* Jquery

###Features
Planned featured are:
* selectable set of correct answers
* optional observation of time to answer all Questions

###Licence
My work is not licenced. This is to allow for future reference by newer and upcoming developers.
